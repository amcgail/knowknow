# Get started

The easiest way to learn how to use knowknow is to try things out yourself. As
you read through this guide, test each method. 

## Prerequisites

Before you get started, you're going to need a few things:

- Your favorite IDE or text editor
- [Python 3.6 or later](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [PIP](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/)


If you haven't already, take a few minutes to read through [Main
concepts](main_concepts.md)

## Set up your virtual environment

Regardless of which package management tool you're using, we recommend running
these commands in a virtual environment. This ensures that the dependencies
pulled in for Streamlit don't impact any other Python projects
you're working on.

- [pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/)
- [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)
- [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)
- [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/)
- [conda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/)
