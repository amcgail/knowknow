============

``knowknow`` is a Python package, knowknow, is an attempt to make powerful, modern tools for analyzing the structure of knowledge open to anyone. Although I hope we can continue to improve the methods and documentation written here, and I intend that this grow larger than myself, this package acts as a stabilizing force for the field, giving us all access to the common methods and data for analyzing these structures.
